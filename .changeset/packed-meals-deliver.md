'starlight-theme-rapide': minor

Removes component overrides for the Starlight `<Banner>` and `<PageTitle>` components.

Previously, the Starlight Rapide theme included overrides for these components to tweak the appearance of [announcement banners](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/#banner) displayed at the top of the page. These changes are now entirely CSS-based without any component overrides.
