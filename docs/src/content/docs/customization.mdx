## Custom CSS

To customize the styles applied to your Starlight site when using the Starlight Rapide theme, you can provide additional CSS files to modify or extend the Starlight and Starlight Rapide theme default styles.

[Learn more about custom CSS in the Starlight documentation.](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles)

## Cascade layers

Like Starlight, the Starlight Rapide theme uses [cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers) internally to manage the order of its styles.
This ensures a predictable CSS order and allows for simpler overrides.
Any custom unlayered CSS will override the default styles from Starlight and the Starlight Rapide theme.

If you are using cascade layers, you can use [`@layer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) in your [custom CSS](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles) to define the order of precedence for different layers relative to styles from the `starlight` and `rapide` layers:

```css "starlight" "rapide"
/* src/styles/custom.css */
@layer my-reset, starlight, rapide, my-overrides;
```

The example above defines a custom layer named `my-reset`, applied before all the Starlight and Starlight Rapide theme layers, and another named `my-overrides`, applied after all Starlight and Starlight Rapide theme layers.
Any styles in the `my-overrides` layer would take precedence over the Starlight and Starlight Rapide theme styles, but Starlight or the Starlight Rapide theme could still change styles set in the `my-reset` layer.
